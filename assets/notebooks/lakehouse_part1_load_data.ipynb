    "### Different types of Iceberg tables in BigQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "BigQuery offers two ways to work with Apache Iceberg tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[BigQuery Tables for Apache Iceberg](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/iceberg-tables#create-iceberg-tables)**.\n",
    "2. **[BigLake metastore with the Iceberg REST catalog](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/blms-rest-catalog)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For most migration and native BigQuery use cases, **BigQuery Tables for Apache Iceberg (managed by BigQuery) is the strongly preferred method.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "**1\\. BigQuery Tables for Apache Iceberg (Managed by BigQuery)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the recommended approach for migrating your data and integrating Iceberg within BigQuery.** These tables offer full BigQuery management of Iceberg, eliminating the need for a separate catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `your-project.your_dataset.your_iceberg_table`(\n",
    "    <column_definition>\n",
    ")\n",
    "WITH CONNECTION `your-region.your_connection_name`\n",
    "OPTIONS (\n",
    "    file_format = 'PARQUET',\n",
    "    table_format = 'ICEBERG',\n",
    "    storage_uri = 'gs://your-bucket/iceberg/your_table_name'\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why should you prefer Managed Tables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "BigQuery-managed Iceberg tables unlock powerful features essential for modern data solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Native Integration:** Seamless experience, similar to standard BigQuery tables.\n",
    "  * **Full DML Support:** Perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE` directly with GoogleSQL.\n",
    "  * **Unified Ingestion:** Supports both batch and high-throughput streaming via the Storage Write API.\n",
    "  * **Schema Evolution:** BigQuery handles schema changes (add, drop, rename columns, type changes) effortlessly.\n",
    "  * **Automatic Optimization:** Benefits from BigQuery's built-in optimizations like adaptive file sizing, clustering, and garbage collection.\n",
    "  * **Robust Security:** Leverage BigQuery's column-level security and data masking.\n",
    "  * **Simplified Operations:** Reduced overhead by letting BigQuery manage the Iceberg table lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method provides a more robust, integrated, and efficient way to leverage Iceberg data within the BigQuery ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "**2\\. BigLake metastore with the Iceberg REST catalog**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These tables allow BigQuery to query Iceberg data managed by external systems like Spark or Hive. They are best for hybrid setups where multiple tools need read access and an external system controls the table's lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `your-project.your_dataset.your_external_iceberg_table`\n",
    "  WITH CONNECTION `your-region.your_connection_name`\n",
    "  OPTIONS (\n",
    "         format = 'ICEBERG',\n",
    "         uris = [\"gs://mybucket/mydata/mytable/metadata/iceberg.metadata.json\"]\n",
    "   )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **External Control:** Metadata and data managed outside BigQuery.\n",
    "  * **Read-Only:** BigQuery can only query; DML operations are not supported.\n",
    "  * **Hybrid Fit:** Ideal for shared access from various tools.\n",
    "  * **Metadata:** Manual updates for static JSON pointers; BigLake Metastore preferred for dynamic syncing in GCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, to leverage the most out of you Iceberg data, prefer the managed tables. They provide better integration and automatic optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have BigQuery centric pipelines, with data generated by BigQuery, managed iceberg tables are the obvious choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose external tables, if you have spark centric pipelines (or another external engine) that generate and write Iceberg data in GCS, and BigQuery only requires read-only access.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real world scenario, you will probably have some of both, so a truly unified data platform would have a mixture of both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will create the 2 different types of tables, to demonstrate that the 2 methods can be combined according to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will generate managed tables for the `bus_stations` and `ridership` datasets, while for the `bus_lines` dataset, we will write iceberg data directly to GCS, using Apache Spark, and mount the data as an external table in BigQuery.\n"
